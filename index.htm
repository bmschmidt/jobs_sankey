  <h1>What are you going to do with that degree?</h1>
  <h3>Jobs by college major</h3>
  This is a quick
  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram>Sankey
    visualization</a> of how college majors relate to professions, based
  on data from the American Community survey. On the left are the largest
  college majors; to the right are the most common professions.<br><br>
  To see broad fields like "Sciences" and "Humanities", see the <a href=http://benschmidt.org/jobsBroad>edited version of this page.</a>
  <br><br>

  The width of each stream shows how many people with that major are in
  that field. (The color shows whether that's more or fewer people than
  expected based on how big the major is: hover over to see just how many more it is.)

  You surely see that the lines are too small to understand in most
  cases:
  <strong> to actually see what's going on with a particular field or job, click on a box and the chart will filter down to just the people who either majored in the field, or ended up employed in the job. </strong>
  (Click on one of the connecting lines to see both at once.)
  <br><br>
  I have not developed this that far because I am not sure how useful it
  ultimately is: my basic goal was a quick way to see, for example, what
  jobs history majors ended up in. (Largest is lawyers, but also
  schoolteachers; what you would expect, but worth knowing.)

    And one last thing, since some people seem to be confused: "miscellaneous managers, including funeral services" doesn't mean <em>only</em> funeral service directors: they're probably a miniscule proportion of all the miscellanies out there.
